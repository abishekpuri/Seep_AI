1) Remember the number of each card value that have gone, remember how many spades have gone
numCardsGone = [13 element] # [2,3...] means 2 aces gone, 3 twos gone
numSpadesGone = [13 element] # [1,1...] means 1 ace spades, 1 two spades


2) create a function that takes in self, move and evaluates its knowledge based on the move
e.g. 
If the move involved making a new pile, you know opponent must have atleast one of that number
If the move involved picking up a pile, you remove the "knowledge" that opponent has that number
Every move involves one new card being shown, update card history 

cardsGone = []

3) The minmax should do the following:

max X : Pr(Opponent has X) * Value of opponent playing X

This will drastically increase search space but should have better results.
